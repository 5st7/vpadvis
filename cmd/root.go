	Short: "CLI tool for generating resource recommendations for Kubernetes workloads",
	Long: `vpadvisor is a CLI tool designed to generate recommendations for Kubernetes workload resources.
This tool fetches Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) recommendations and generates reports that compare the current settings 
with suggested values, supporting multiple formats like Markdown and YAML for easy integration and readability.

Example usage:
  vpadvisor generate --format markdown`,
}

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)

}

func init() {
	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.
	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.vpadvis.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
